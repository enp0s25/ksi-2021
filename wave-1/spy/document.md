## About program
- since I wanted to use icons I had to upload `.zip` instead of just `.py`, I hope that it isn't a problem
- on startup program attempts to open file `log.txt` if such file is located in current directory
- files with GPS data can also be loaded while program is already running
- program uses `GPGGA` sentences to draw path, also is able to validate checksum of sentences
